### Content Insights

This week I focused on collaboration tools and source control. Setting up and using Trello helped me see how agile planning works in real projects. I contributed by creating tasks for our group setup phase, such as GitHub repo creation and domain brainstorming. I learned the importance of card organization and the value of assigning tasks with due dates and labels.

I also explored Git through Visual Studio Code and realized how powerful and intuitive Git integration can be when paired with GitHub. I committed and pushed my first change to the team repo and got familiar with Git commands in the GUI.

Additionally, I dove into GitHub Actions. While it’s still a bit complex, I gained foundational knowledge on how deployment can be automated through `.yml` files and triggers. This makes me appreciate how real-world development workflows operate behind the scenes.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week’s work gave me hands-on exposure to modern tools used in web development teams. Being able to plan using Trello and manage code using GitHub are both critical skills that employers look for. GitHub Actions introduced me to the concept of continuous integration and deployment, which is common in professional workflows.

One major takeaway was how combining **written resources** (like documentation) with **visual learning** (like tutorials) helps me retain information more effectively. I now plan to use this learning style moving forward.
