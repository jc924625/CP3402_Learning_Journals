# CP3402 Content Management Systems – Week 7  

---

### Learning Activities & Resources

This week I focused on learning about PHP authentication and how it connects to building dynamic CMS-style websites. I also explored professional WordPress workflows using tools like Vagrant, Git, and database synchronization for real-world team environments.

Resources I engaged with:

- [Simple Login System in PHP (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEVW5ucNNDY)
- [The Ultimate Workflow Guide for WordPress Teams (Roketco)](https://roketco.com/log/the-ultimate-workflow-guide-for-teams-building-wordpress-sites-with-acf-timber-foundation-and-local-machines-with-remote-servers-through-vagrant-and-git/)
- [VVV (Varying Vagrant Vagrants) GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)
- [Synchronize WordPress Databases (SitePoint)](https://www.sitepoint.com/synchronize-wordpress-live-development-databases/)
- [WordPress Environment Setup (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jZ9lrSpqk)

## Content Insights

While working on my Advice Shop PHP project, I implemented a full login and signup system using file-based user storage. This helped me understand:

- How to use PHP sessions to keep users logged in
- How to securely handle form inputs and store user credentials
- How `$_SESSION`, `file()`, and `explode()` work together for basic auth
- Why `session_start()` must be called only once and before any output

The additional WordPress materials taught me how **professional teams manage CMS development**. I saw how tools like Vagrant (via VVV), Git, and remote workflows allow safe local development with deployment pipelines. These ideas inspired me to think ahead to real-world site building beyond the classroom.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week gave me valuable hands-on experience building a login system — something I now realize is essential for most client websites. It also clarified the structure of modular PHP code, which is something I struggled with before. I can now see how `include()` can be used properly to keep things organized and reusable.

The WordPress dev workflow content showed me what advanced developers use daily — such as syncing local and live databases, version control via Git, and setting up local dev environments.
