## Learning Activities & Resources

- Watched YouTube tutorials on Sass variables, mixins, and Gulp automation.
- Read documentation on Gulp from [gulpjs.com](https://gulpjs.com/)
- Troubleshot PowerShell execution policy errors using Microsoft support links.
- Referenced VS Code and Node.js documentation to resolve local setup issues.

## Content Insights

This week I learned how to structure a front-end project using **Sass**, and automate the workflow with **Gulp**. I understood the benefits of using Sass features like:

- **Variables** for maintainable styling (e.g., shared color values)
- **Mixins** for reusable code (e.g., flexbox layout)
- **Nesting** to mirror HTML structure
- **@extend** to reduce CSS repetition

I also gained practical skills in setting up and troubleshooting **Gulp** tasks and using `npx` to compile SCSS. Learning how to automate the build process using `gulp.watch()` was particularly useful, as it speeds up styling workflow without manual compiling.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This task helped bridge the gap between classroom CSS and industry-ready frontend workflows. Using Gulp introduced me to the idea of **build pipelines**, which are used in real-world environments to manage CSS preprocessing, JavaScript bundling, and asset optimization. 

Fixing the execution policy error in PowerShell gave me confidence in dealing with system-level issues that often pop up in development. It showed me the importance of being comfortable with your development environment, not just the code.

Overall, I feel more prepared to work on team projects or client websites where scalable, clean CSS and automated tooling is expected. I’ll continue using Sass and Gulp in future personal projects to build stronger habits.
